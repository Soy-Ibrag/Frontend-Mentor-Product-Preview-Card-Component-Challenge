# Product Preview Card Component

## 📄 Project Overview

This is a solution to the [Product Preview Card Component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa) on Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build a responsive product card that matches the design as closely as possible. The project helped me practice implementing responsive layouts using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox.

## 💡 Biggest Challenges

One of the major challenges was ensuring the layout remained consistent across various screen sizes. Implementing the responsive design required a deeper understanding of Flexbox properties and how to adapt elements to smaller screens. Additionally, attention to detail was essential to match the design's spacing, colors, and typography.
